This is a Universal Windows Platform application. It's capable to recognize a previously given persons face from a photograph, taken by the camera or uploaded from file. The app uses Microsoft's Azure service for image processing. It only handles uploading and data presentation. Photographs from the person to recognise should be placed under the folder `Assets/admin/`
